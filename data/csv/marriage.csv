"CL","Okinawans","AC07","2","A younger “wife” is usually taken if there is no male heir born by the legal wife or if the marriage remains childless altogether.","Legally a man cannot have more than one wife, but there are cases of multiple marriage even in Taira. It takes a substantial income for such an arrangement, since a second wife is given a separate place to live.","431","Maretzki, T. W., Maretzki, H., & Whiting, B. B. (1963).

"SK","Quinault","NR17","1.5","Polygamy seems to be relatively rare, but permissible, restricted to rich or powerful individuals (e.g. chiefs). If practiced, the primary mode was sororal polygyny (i.e. sister-wives).","Polygyny was permissible but ordinarily only chiefs or lesser nobles had (or could afford) more than one wife.","108","Olson, Ronald L.

"FJ","Māori","OZ04","2","The coding scheme needs some work for precisely this class-based observation","The marriage rule observed by the mass of the people was one wife at one time, but chiefs sometimes exercised the privileges of rank and wealth by having more than one. Thus, monogamy or more accurately monogyny (one wife) was the general rule and polygamy or polygyny (plural wives) was much less common.","369","Buck, Peter Henry. 1952. The Coming of the Maori.
