"LA","Ganda","FK07","2","Multiple sisters may marry one man (sorrel polygyny), only richer or higher status men have multiple wives","Sororal polygyny is not uncommon,in the old days, a chief would sleep with one of his wives or receive confidential messengers from the Kabaka, When a man married more than one wife, he built a separate house for each; the houses were generally side by side, and were enclosed by a fence. He had his own house in front of the womens quarters, and the wives visited him, and slept in his house, when he invited them to do so.Fourteen of the babies lived in households either known to be monogamous or assumed to be so because no other wives were present or mentioned. Seven babies lived in obviously polygynous households; three of the households in question were Muslim, two Church of England.","270, 54, 83, 32","Richards, Audrey I.
